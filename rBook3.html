      <h1>Review</h1>
      <ol>
        <li>Enjoyed this a lot although I did not have many hopes. I bought the book because i found it as book deal on kindle. I am really happy that I the book read since I learned a lot about old Malaya's culture and history. Also, it was fascinating how the author introduced the reader into the world of the Chinese-Malayan myths about the afterlife.</li>
        <br />
        <li>What I liked the most about this book is how beautifully the author describes the sights and culture of Malaya. I remember reading about some food the main character was eating at the  <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">party and it made me seriously crave for what she was eating. I do not think this happened in other books I read. She made me see, smell and feel, just like i was there inside the book.</span></li>
        <br />
        <span id="dots2" style="color:rgb(0,0,0,0)">...</span><span id="moreMore">
        <li>The first chapters of The Ghost Bride had me hooked. I have always enjoyed reading about Asian families, Asian history and culture. The audio is narrated quite beautifully by the author, and it was very calming to listen to her as the atmosphere and characters were formed. Then the dream sequences began and an endless journey into an underground spirit world. I came off that hook I was attached to real fast, as new character after new character was introduced and the storyline went off into fantasies and confusing subplots that I wanted no part of.
          <br />
          <li>Having grown up in Singapore, with a mother from Malaysia, I was thrilled to read a book set in Malacca, a town I visited many times in my childhood. Yangsze Choo has done a fantastic job of creating the mood and place of Malacca. She has clearly done her homework! Her novel is a great read, full of adventure and twists and turns, I could barely put it down once I started into it. I loved the detailed descriptions of the clothing and food. It made me nostalgic for yummy Malaysian food!</li>
          <br />
          <li>This is probably not a book I should have read, I think it is brilliantly written and it is certainly about a little explored subject. The tone is almost dreamy, which is expected because so much of the book takes place in dreams. Which leads me to my problem with the book, I love learning about new cultures, so Malaysia as the country was enticing. It was just too much fantasy for me, too much of the dreaming and the dead. Just not my cup of tea, but I know others have loved and will love this book.</li>
